# P-values discussion with Prof. Philip B. Stark

This lecture was a discussion on the role of p-values in statistical research, the assumptions that underlie their definition, and how to critically consider the constructions of hypotheses.

The background readings were the [ASA's statement on p-values](http://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108#.Wg1GP7Q-dE4) (along with supporting commentaries) and the paper ["Redefine statistical significance"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0189-z).

The complete lecture by prof. Stark was ["P-values, Probability, Priors, Rabbits, Quantifauxcation, and Cargo-Cult Statistics"](rabbits.slides.html)
